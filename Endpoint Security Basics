# Lab 2 : Endpoint Security Basics

## Objective 

Learn how to secure endpoints, understand vulnerabilities, and practice basic hardening techniques. 
Focus on understanding how antivirus, firewalls and OS settings protect a machine 

## Tools used 
- Ubuntu/ Windows Vm ( Target machine)
- Kali linux VM (optional, for testing attacks)
- Built-in firewall (Windows Firewall / UFW on Ubuntu) 
- some free antivirus 
- VirtualBox snapshots (to safely revert VMs)

## Lab Setup Plan 
- Use Host-Only Network in Virtual Box for isolated environment 
-Assign Static Ips for machines 
 - Windows/ Ubuntu Target : Ip address ? 
  - Kali Analyzer (optional) : Ip address ?
- Enable snapshots so changes can be safely reverted 

 ## (Steps) 
1. Check default firewall and antivirus status on the target VM 
2. Perform basic OS hardening: 
 - Update packages and OS 
 - Disable unused services 
 - Create a limited user account 
3. Test Security by simulting basic attacks (Optional): 
 - ping sweep 
- Nmap port scan from kali 
4. Document any alerts generated by firewalls or antivirus 

##Expected Deliverables 
- Readme.md documenting all steps and findings 
- Screenshots or logs showing firewall/ antivirus behvior (Optional)
- Notes on what was learned about endpoint security 

## Current Status
- Lab folder created 
 - Planning phase complete 
- Will add findings and screenshots after hands-on testing
