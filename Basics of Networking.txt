Lab1_Basics_of_Networking

## Objective
Understand network traffic, open ports, protocols, and identify suspicious vs normal behavior. 

## Tools Used 
- Wireshark 
- VirtualBox
- Kali Linux
- Ubuntu VM 

## Lab Setup 
- Network : Host-Only Network in VirtualBox 
-Vms
 - Kali linux : 
- Ubuntu : 

## Steps 
1. Installed Wireshark on Kali linux 
2. Generated traffic on Ubuntu VM : ping, HTTP requests, simple file transfer
3. Captured traffic using Wireshark
4. Performed port scanning using nmap 
5. Analyzed protocals and open ports 
6. Distinguished normal vs suspicious traffic

## Findings 


## Key Learnings 
- Network traffic can be captured and analyzed 
- Port scanning reveals open services 
-Understanding normal traffic is crucial for detecting anomalies
